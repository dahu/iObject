INTRODUCTION                                    *iObject*

iObject is an extra set of |text-objects| to further enhance this useful
feature of Vim. The following text objects are provided by iObject:

|iObject-Numbers|

NUMBERS                                         *iObject-numbers*

iObject provides two new text objects for manipulating Numbers (Integers):

                                                *v_anumber*
                                                *v_an*
an			"a number". Selects the number under the cursor,
			including possible leading -/+ characters.

                                                *v_anumber*
                                                *v_an*
in			"inside a number". Selects the number under the
			cursor, excluding possible leading -/+ characters.

ISSUES                                          *iObject-issues*

Clearly more text-objects are needed to justify being able to call this a
plugin. Planned additional text objects include:

- Floats
- Dates
- Elements (comma delimited parts of lists)

Comments, suggestions, new ideas and contributions welcome.
